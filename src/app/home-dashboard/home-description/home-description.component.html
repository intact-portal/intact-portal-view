  <h3><i class="icon icon-species padding-medium" data-icon="&#x76;"></i> COVID19-related interactions at IntAct's
    Coronavirus dataset</h3>
  Dataset of molecular interactions extracted from publications involving viral proteins from the Coronaviridae family
  and human proteins, along with a certain proportion of other model organisms. The data features mostly protein-protein
  and some RNA-protein interactions and covers SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV primarily, with some interactions from other
  members of Coronaviridae as well. Interactions between human proteins relevant for SARS-CoV2 infection have also been
  included.
