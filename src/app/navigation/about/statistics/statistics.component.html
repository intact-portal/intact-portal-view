  <h2>Interactions over time</h2>
  <ip-multiline-graph [dataPath]="'./assets/data-files/interactions.csv'"></ip-multiline-graph>
  <p>
    Interactions over time, based on interaction reports.
    An "interaction report" or "evidence" is a report of one interaction by one method in one publication.
    An n-ary interaction has more than two participants. For the sake of comparison and computational processing,
    n-ary interactions are often expanded to multiple binary interactions following the "spoke model".
    See <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/documentation/user-guide#expansion_method">Expansion Method</a> for more information.
    The time assigned to an interaction report is the date the interaction evidence is created in IntAct.

  <h2>Publications & experiments over time</h2>
  <ip-multiline-graph [dataPath]="'./assets/data-files/publication_experiment.csv'"></ip-multiline-graph>
  <p>One "Experiment" is the data derived form one method in one publication. A single publication can report multiple experiments,
  for example a large-scale method, and subsequent validation of a subset of interactions with a small scale method.</p>

  <h2>Interactions by curation reason</h2>
  <ip-multiline-graph [dataPath]="'./assets/data-files/curation_distribution.csv'"></ip-multiline-graph>
  <p>Curators can choose publications to curate. This can be dependent on funding priority. Besides this,
    curations can be requested by the author, or submitted by the author.

  <h2>Interactions by detection method</h2>
  <ip-donut-graph [dataPath]="'./assets/data-files/method_distribution.csv'" [threshold]="8"></ip-donut-graph>
  <p>Distributions are determined on the number of interaction evidences in IntAct.</p>
